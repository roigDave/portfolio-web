                  <p class="bio-text">I’m an enthusiast of many good things, loving music, good reads, cinema and art in general. In my free time I love learning new things, as well as trying to create, be it with graphic design, literature or music (with highly varying degrees of success).</p>
                  <p class="bio-text">I’m hooked on coffee and there are little things that I enjoy more in life than exchanging ideas with someone in a nice cozy cafeteria.

              <h3>If something can be said about me is that I’m, at least, intellectually restless.</h3>
              <p class="bio-text">I started my studies as a classicist studying <span class="text-important">Classical and Antiquity Studies</span>, a beautiful bachelor’s degree unique to Spain.</p>
              <div class="bio-bg bio-bg-1"></div>
              <p class="bio-text">Soon thereafter, I stopped my studies as a classicist. While history, archeology and dead languages are beautiful subjects, my passion for coding, which I had since I was a little kid and spent my weekends making my own video games, was calling to me too strongly, and I could no longer deny it.</p>
              <p class="bio-text">That’s when I got a 3 years <span class="text-important">technical degree in Cross-Platform Software Development</span>, a very to the point technical degree with a curriculum of many coding languages as well as a surprisingly in-depth education regarding database design. While this education allowed me to become a junior developer and a very successful internship got me some job offers in the field, I decided at the time to continue with my current company, SignSpain, while I enrolled in the <span class="text-important">Software Engineering bachelor’s degree</span>, to get some in depth knowledge of mathematics and electronics, fields that the technical degree only went over on a need-to-know basis.</p>
              <p class="bio-text">As of today, I've finished half of the degree, but my desire for challenge led me to decide to leave the country, so I'm waiting until the next scholar year to resume it in Ireland.
