              <h3>If something can be said about me is that I’m, at least, intellectually restless.</h3>
              <p class="bio-text">I started my studies as a classicist studying <span class="text-important">Classical and Antiquity Studies</span>, a beautiful bachelor’s degree unique to Spain.</p>

              <p class="bio-text">Soon thereafter, I stopped my studies as a classicist. While history, archeology and dead languages are beautiful subjects, my passion for coding, which I had since I was a little kid and spent my weekends making my own video games, was calling to me too strongly, and I could no longer deny it.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="bio-text">That’s when I got a 3 years <span class="text-important">technical degree in Cross-Platform Software Development</span>, a very to the point technical degree with a curriculum of many coding languages as well as a surprisingly in-depth education regarding database design. While this education allowed me to become a junior developer and a very successful internship got me some job offers in the field, I decided at the time to continue with my current company, SignSpain, while I enrolled in the <span class="text-important">Software Engineering bachelor’s degree</span>, to get some in depth knowledge of mathematics and electronics, fields that the technical degree only went over on a need-to-know basis.</p>
              <p class="bio-text">As of today, I've finished half of the degree, but my desire for challenge led me to decide to leave the country, so I'm waiting until the next scholar year to resume it in Ireland.

                <p class="bio-text">SignSpain was a challenging prospect as the <span class="text-important">branding/signage industry</span> was a mystery for me, and the scope of the projects together with the <span class="text-important">notability from the international clients</span> (most of my more memorable projects were for the top companies in the world) created a very high level of exigency, which helped me develop a very good instinct for detecting possible issues.</p>
                <p class="bio-text">While project managing was my principal role and the one that took most of my time, I also was able to fulfill other roles when time allowed it, mainly as a <span class="text-important">graphic designer, digitalisation technician, surveying, as well as a representative (in the BNI network) and salesman</span> for both SignSpain and its sister company, <span class="text-important">Icónica Imagen.</span></p>
                <p class="bio-text">The huge national and international reach of the projects was a very exciting aspect of the job. Most of my projects were done simultaneously in all main areas of Spain, with some of them also being realized in <span class="text-important">France, Morocco and Portugal</span>, each country with its own set of difficulties due to both procedural and cultural differences. Some of the most notorious ones are showcased on the <a href="work.html">Works</a> section of this web.</p>

                  My work in GFI, nowadays rebranded as <span class="text-important">Inetum</span>, was a great way to start my career in this field.</p>
                  <p class="bio-text">
                  Thanks to my high grades in the degree I was allowed to choose where to do my internship, and GFI, being the only big international company among the candidates, was a clear-cut winner.
                  After a couple days of absorbing documentation and shadowing a senior I was able to fully join one of the big projects that were ongoing currently, the maintenance and improvement of a recently launched <span class="text-important">web application</span> for the regional administration to control monetary aids for individuals. This was a beautiful way to fly the nest! This project involved <span class="text-important">an SQL database, Javascript, CSS, HTML and Java, with a very well applied MVC architecture and an agile approach</span> to issue and improvement handling.</p>
                  <p class="bio-text">
                  Within my first weeks in GFI, <span class="text-important">the world came to a stop</span> with the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic and the first lockdown. Fortunately, I had already become a part of the team, so I was the only intern allowed to take my terminal home and continue remotely.</p>
                  <p class="bio-text">
                  Ultimately, my time at GFI was short, but it was a very good way to learn the ropes of span <class="text-important">teamwork</span> in professional software development. The relationship with the company ended in very good notes and I was offered to continue past my internship, but at that time I decided to continue in SignSpain, where, despite the pandemic, huge and challenging projects were undergoing.</p>
                  <p class="bio-text">
